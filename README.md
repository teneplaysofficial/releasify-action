## How to Create a Discord Webhook

1. Open **Server Settings** in your Discord server.
2. Navigate to **Integrations → Webhooks**.
3. Click **New Webhook**.
4. Choose:

   - A target channel (where messages will appear)
   - Optional: Name and avatar

5. Click **Copy Webhook URL** (e.g., `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...`)

## Add the Webhook to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to **GitHub Repo → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Add:

   - **Name:** `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`
   - **Value:** Paste your Discord Webhook URL

## How It Works

- When a new GitHub **release** is published:

  1. This Action triggers automatically on the tag
  2. It builds a styled Discord embed message using release info
  3. It sends the embed to your Discord channel using your webhook

## Example Output on Discord

When triggered, you'll see a styled embed message like:

```
🚀 New Release: v1.2.3 in my-repo
- Includes release notes
- Download links: [dist.zip](...), [TAR](...), etc.
- Author: @username
```
